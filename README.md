# Library Management System

Main Window is the first and basic session of the system.

Create Database sql script needs to be run in MySQL workbench before any other file, it will create our database and tables
with the necessary relations between them. There are two tables, books and issued_books. The book_id attribute acts as the foreign key.

The database will be stored by the name of "library", if a pre-existing database by same name exists, the sql script will delete it.
